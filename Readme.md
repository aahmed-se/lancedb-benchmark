# lanceDB Benchmark

This is a Python-based tool for generating, storing, and querying large sets of high-dimensional vectors. It utilizes `lancedb` for efficient database handling and `numpy` for vector operations, making it suitable for experiments with vector search algorithms and performance testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.6 or higher.
- You have installed `numpy` and `lancedb` Python libraries.

```shell
pip install numpy lancedb
```


### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/aahmed-se/lancedb-benchmark.git
cd lancedb-benchmark
```

### Usage
To run the benchmak adjust the paramters in the code and run it.
